As far as I can remember, I‚Äôve always been curious about how the web works‚Äîand, for that matter, how the world works.

This first blog post (ever) covers my early expectations, challenges, and my ongoing journey to mastering the web. It‚Äôs a personal account of how I use that same curiosity to produce groundbreaking results.

## Early days - Summer 2023

I knew I had a tough time ahead of me when I decided to embark on this coding journey, which at many times, _left me glaring aimlessly at my screen wondering if I made the right choice._

At the time I was facing many life obstacles, the main one being laid off from my job. With the extra time I had gained thanks to that... I decided it was finally time to bet on myself.

I began by googling oddly-specific topics, like "Are web Developers still in demand" to see where the current market stands. Which is what I needed to reassure myself that pursuing a career in web development is still a valuable and viable choice in today's evolving tech industry.

**But** It wasn't until I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR1ydijTx5E) that I felt hopeful about the possibility of being self-taught and landing a job with virtually no experience!

The video discusses YouTuber Tim Kim and his journey, detailing how he dropped out of college to ultimately pursue a successful career in software development. I used his story as a backbone and structure to frame my discussion, which I will highlight.

## Use free resources üíª

I can't stress this enough, If you're reading this a self-taught developer you...have...to take advantage of free resources!

Here are some that got the ball rolling for me:

- (Okay, I lied, this first resource isn‚Äôt free!) **Udemy**: While it‚Äôs a paid platform, if you keep an eye out, you can often find flash sales that make courses extremely affordable. I had to include this because it was the first course I took, specifically the [100 Days Of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=NEWYEARCAREER) course by Academind's Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and Manuel Lorenz.
- **FreeCodeCamp**: A comprehensive platform for learning web development, data analysis, and algorithms through hands-on projects.

  - **The Odin Project**: An all-in-one curriculum that walks you through full-stack development with clear roadmaps.

- **Frontend Mentor**: A platform where you can practice building real-world projects by working on professionally designed challenges. It‚Äôs perfect for improving your frontend skills and building a strong portfolio.

- YouTube: Channels like Net Ninja offer high-quality, free tutorials for all skill levels.
- MDN Web Docs: Your go-to resource for in-depth documentation and guides on web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

There are ton's of other great tools that didn‚Äôt make this list, but I encourage you to explore and try at least one!

## How to avoid burnout

During the early learning stages, I realized that reshaping my learning methods was essential to make consistent progress. Here‚Äôs what worked for me:

1. Take Breaks üõë

   Learning to code can be intense, so it‚Äôs important to step back and recharge. I followed a simple habit: take regular breaks to stretch, grab a snack, or go for a short walk. These breaks helped me avoid mental fatigue and stay sharp during longer study sessions.

2. Stay Positive üåü

   There were moments of frustration when things didn‚Äôt make sense, but maintaining a positive mindset was crucial. I flexed small wins‚Äîfixing a bug, completing a project, or understanding a tricky concept. Remember: progress, no matter how small, is still _progress_.

3. Use the Pomodoro Technique ‚è±

   I broke my study sessions into manageable chunks using the Pomodoro Technique: 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. This method kept me productive while preventing burnout.

4. Join Communities ü§ù

   I found a lot of support in tech stack-specific Discord servers. These communities are full of like-minded learners and experienced developers who can help when you‚Äôre stuck. Asking questions and engaging with others made the journey less isolating.

5. Escape Tutorial Hell üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

   It‚Äôs easy to get stuck passively watching tutorials without applying what you‚Äôve learned. The best way to learn is by doing! After finishing a tutorial, I challenged myself to build something similar from scratch or tweak the project to make it my own.

6. Start Coding üíª

   At the end of the day, nothing beats hands-on experience. I focused on coding as much as possible, even if it meant making mistakes. Every project, no matter how small, brought me closer to my goal.

## Conclusion

Although I‚Äôm sharing these tips with you, I want to be transparent: I‚Äôm by no means a master developer yet. There‚Äôs still so much to learn, and my journey is far from over. Every day brings new challenges, but it‚Äôs all part of the process. What matters is that I‚Äôm progressing, and I hope you found some of the resources and tips I‚Äôve shared useful in your own journey.

As a bonus, I‚Äôd like to share where I currently stand: right now, I‚Äôm focusing on learning optimization techniques to improve user experience and speed. It‚Äôs an exciting area to dive into, as I strive to build more efficient, performant applications that deliver the best possible experience for users.

The road ahead is long, but I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing to learn and grow as a developer. Thanks for reading, and I hope this post inspires you to keep pushing forward on your own path!
